{"id":"line-40e","title":"Spike: tmux-based streaming for line logs -f","description":"## Background\n\nAll cheaper streaming approaches have been ruled out:\n\n| Mode | Result |\n|---|---|\n| `-p` + creack/pty (current) | Batches output internally — one chunk at end |\n| `-p --verbose` | Identical to `-p` — no change to output timing (verified 2026-02-19 via pty-spike binary) |\n| `-p --output-format stream-json --verbose` | Turn-level JSON events, not token streaming. Undocumented/unstable format, JSON parsing complexity. Ruled out in previous session. |\n| Interactive PTY (no `-p`) | NO-GO: ~16s startup overhead, requires full VT100 terminal emulator to extract text, ❯  prompt detection doesn't work as a byte scan (cursor-positioned). See detergent-nus. |\n\n## Proposed approach: tmux\n\nRun Claude inside a detached tmux session. Poll `capture-pane` for output. This is what Gas Town (github.com/steveyegge/gastown) does in production.\n\n### How it would work\n\n1. Before invoking agent: `tmux new-session -d -s \u003cname\u003e -x 220 -y 50 \"claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p \u003ccontextfile\u003e\"`\n2. Poll `tmux capture-pane -t \u003cname\u003e -p` on an interval (e.g. 500ms) and append new lines to the log file\n3. Detect completion: scan capture-pane output for `❯ ` prefix (works because capture-pane returns plain text, not raw PTY bytes — this is what Gas Town does)\n4. Alternatively: just wait for the tmux session to exit (process completes)\n5. Clean up: `tmux kill-session -t \u003cname\u003e`\n\n### Gas Town patterns worth borrowing\n\n- **SIGWINCH wake trick**: Detached tmux sessions may not process stdin until a resize event. Gas Town does `resize-pane -y -1` then `+1` to wake the event loop. May be needed if Claude doesn't start responding.\n- **send-keys -l + Enter**: Gas Town sends text literally then Enter as a separate key. For `-p` mode we pass the context file as an arg, so this may not be needed.\n- **capture-pane for clean text**: Unlike raw PTY bytes, `tmux capture-pane -p` returns rendered text with ANSI stripped. ❯  detection works reliably.\n\n### Key unknowns (this is a spike)\n\n1. Does `claude -p \u003ccontextfile\u003e` actually stream tool-call progress lines to the terminal in real time? (The pty-spike showed the final answer arrives in one blob, but tool-call lines may stream earlier with a longer-running prompt.)\n2. Does capture-pane output update progressively during the run, or only after completion?\n3. What is the tmux session startup overhead vs current approach?\n4. Does the SIGWINCH wake trick matter for `-p` mode (vs interactive mode)?\n5. Is `--dangerously-skip-permissions` still needed / sufficient inside tmux?\n\n### Definition of done\n\nWrite a standalone test or binary (extend cmd/pty-spike or create cmd/tmux-spike) that:\n1. Starts `claude -p \u003ccontextfile\u003e` in a detached tmux session\n2. Polls capture-pane on a 500ms interval, printing each new line as it arrives\n3. Detects session exit or idle prompt\n4. Reports: do lines appear progressively during tool use, or all at end?\n5. Documents startup overhead and any SIGWINCH requirement\n\nResult: go/no-go for tmux, with clear notes on what detergent would need to implement.\n\n## Dependency / trade-offs\n\n- tmux is not pre-installed on macOS (requires `brew install tmux`)\n- tmux is commonly available in CI/Linux environments\n- Suggested design: make streaming optional — if tmux is not found, fall back to current `-p` mode silently\n- This would be a new runtime dependency, not a Go module dependency","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"daniel@ajps.limited","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:53:06.21994Z","created_by":"Daniel Jones","updated_at":"2026-02-20T22:55:31.553128Z","closed_at":"2026-02-20T22:55:31.553128Z","close_reason":"Created tmux-spike binary for investigating tmux-based streaming.

Use \u003cNEW_NAME\u003e as a placeholder until the name is chosen.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Choose the new name\n- User provides the replacement name before execution begins\n\n### 2. Rename directories\n- `cmd/detergent/` → `cmd/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e/`\n- `.claude/skills/detergent-rebase/` → `.claude/skills/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e-rebase/`\n- `.claude/skills/detergent-start/` → `.claude/skills/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e-start/`\n- `internal/assets/skills/detergent-rebase/` → `internal/assets/skills/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e-rebase/`\n- `internal/assets/skills/detergent-start/` → `internal/assets/skills/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e-start/`\n- `openspec/specs/detergent/` → `openspec/specs/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e/`\n\n### 3. Update Go module path\n- `go.mod`: `github.com/re-cinq/detergent` → `github.com/re-cinq/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e`\n- All import statements in `.go` files (use `goimports` or scripted replacement)\n\n### 4. Global find-and-replace in source files\nCase-sensitive replacements across all `.go`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.md`, `.ts`, `.sh`, `.json` files:\n- `detergent` → `\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e` (lowercase)\n- `Detergent` → `\u003cNEW_NAME_CAPITALIZED\u003e` (title case, used in docs/VitePress)\n- `.detergent/` → `.\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e/` (runtime directory)\n- `detergent.yaml` / `detergent.yml` → `\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e.yaml` / `\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e.yml`\n\n### 5. Update build/release config\n- `Makefile`: `BINARY_NAME := detergent` → `BINARY_NAME := \u003cNEW_NAME\u003e`\n- `.goreleaser.yaml`: binary name, project name, ldflags paths\n- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build references\n- `scripts/install.sh`: `REPO=\"re-cinq/detergent\"` and all references\n\n### 6. Update skill definitions\n- Skill names in `SKILL.md` files (`detergent-rebase` → `\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e-rebase`, etc.)\n- Embedded skill references in `internal/assets/`\n- Statusline command in `internal/cli/statusline.go` and `internal/cli/init.go`\n\n### 7. Update documentation\n- `README.md`\n- `docs/` VitePress site (config.ts title, all guide pages)\n- `docs/package.json` name field\n- `PLAN.md`, `openspec/config.yaml`\n\n### 8. Update beads/issue tracker references\n- `.beads/issues.jsonl` contains \"detergent\" in descriptions — update or leave as historical\n\n### 9. Rename GitHub repo\n- Rename `re-cinq/detergent` → `re-cinq/\u003cNEW_NAME\u003e` on GitHub (manual step)\n\n### 10. Verify\n- `go build ./...` — confirms module path and imports are consistent\n- `go test ./...` — runs all unit tests\n- Run acceptance tests: `make test-acceptance` (or equivalent)\n- `go vet ./...` — static analysis\n- Grep for any remaining `detergent` occurrences (expect zero outside git history and `.beads/` historical entries)\n\n## Key files to modify\n- `go.mod`\n- `cmd/detergent/main.go`\n- `internal/cli/root.go`, `internal/cli/init.go`, `internal/cli/statusline.go`\n- `internal/cli/*.go` (all ~13 files)\n- `internal/engine/*.go`\n- `internal/config/*.go`\n- `internal/git/git.go`\n- `Makefile`, `.goreleaser.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`\n- `scripts/install.sh`\n- `.claude/skills/detergent-*/SKILL.md`\n- `internal/assets/skills/detergent-*/SKILL.md`\n- `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`, `docs/package.json`\n- `docs/*.md`, `README.md`\n- `openspec/config.yaml`, `openspec/specs/detergent/spec.md`\n\n## Approach\nMost of this is a scripted sed/rename pass followed by manual verification.

The user reports it \"keeps happening.\"\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\n### What was ruled out\n\n1. **No sub-claude set it.** All 6 session transcripts were searched for `core.bare`, `--bare`, and `git config` commands. No Claude agent or sub-agent ever ran `git config core.bare true`.\n\n2. **Acceptance tests don't trigger it.** Full test suite was run with before/after config comparison — `core.bare` stayed `false`.\n\n3. **`git worktree add` doesn't cause it.** Reproduced the exact worktree creation pattern (including nested worktrees inside `.line/worktrees/`) on git 2.51.1 — `core.bare` stays `false`.\n\n4. **The assembly-line Go code never touches `core.bare`.** Grepped entire codebase for `bare` in `*.go` files — zero matches.\n\n5. **Git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit) don't set it.** Both hooks only call `line gate` and `line trigger` respectively.\n\n### What WAS found\n\n**VS Code is actively writing to `.git/config`.** A polling monitor on the config file caught VS Code's git extension modifying the config at 14:09:01, adding:\n\n```\n[branch \"main\"]\n    vscode-merge-base = origin/master\n```\n\nThe config already had similar `vscode-merge-base` entries for `master` and `line/deadcode` branches.\n\n**Stale worktree entries exist.** The main repo's `.git/worktrees/` contains orphan entries (`readme`, `security`) pointing to deleted temp directories from previous test runs. This corrupted worktree state may confuse VS Code's git extension.\n\n**Additional config corruption:** `user.name=Test` and `user.email=test@test.com` are set in the main repo's local config. These match acceptance test fixture values but were NOT set by the test helpers (which use env vars). Origin unknown but likely related to the same config-writing race.\n\n### Root cause theory\n\nVS Code's git extension and the line runner (which spawns Claude agents that run git commands in worktrees) are concurrently writing to `.git/config`. When VS Code rewrites the config file while another process is also modifying it, a race condition can produce corrupted config state including `core.bare=true`.\n\n### Timeline (2026-02-21)\n\n- 11:24 — Repo cloned\n- 13:09 — Previous Claude session ended (no bare issue)\n- 13:36-13:45 — Line runner created worktrees, processed concerns\n- 13:38 — Claude agent spawned in worktree (PID 43578)\n- 13:53 — `.git/config` last modified (core.bare=true discovered)\n- 14:00 — Manual fix: `git config core.bare false`\n- 14:09 — Monitor caught VS Code writing to config again\n\n## Possible fixes\n\n1. **Guard in `line` CLI**: Check and auto-repair `core.bare=false` at startup (in `loadConfigAndRepo` or similar) before any working-tree operations.\n2. **Clean up orphan worktrees**: Run `git worktree prune` after test runs and in the runner cleanup path to prevent stale entries that may confuse VS Code.\n3. **VS Code setting**: Disable `git.mergeBase` or exclude repo from VS Code git auto-detection.","notes":"## Implementation\n\n### Completed\n1. **Auto-repair guard in CLI**: Implemented core.bare guard in loadConfigAndRepo() that automatically detects and repairs core.bare=true corruption. This ensures the repo remains usable even if the race condition occurs.\n\n### Status\nThe auto-repair guard mitigates the immediate impact of the corruption. The root cause race condition between VS Code's git extension and line runner still exists, but users will no longer be stuck with an unusable repository.\n\n### Next Steps (if issue persists)\n1. Add per-worktree git config isolation to prevent cross-config race conditions\n2. Implement VS Code extension configuration to disable git.mergeBase\n3.

{"id":"line-g2r","title":"Support .detergentignore for filtering trigger files","description":"## Problem\n\nEvery commit to a watched branch triggers the concern pipeline, even for changes that don't need review — beads metadata (.beads/), documentation, CI config, etc. This wastes agent API calls and adds latency for no value.\n\nFor example, committing a new bead issue (`.beads/issues.jsonl`) triggers the full concern chain even though no code changed.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd `.detergentignore` support, using `.gitignore` syntax, that filters commits before triggering concerns. If ALL changed files in a commit match ignore patterns, skip the commit entirely.\n\n### Behavior\n\n- File lives at repo root: `.detergentignore`\n- Uses `.gitignore` pattern syntax (globs, `!` negation, `#` comments, directory trailing `/`)\n- Applied during commit diffing in `processConcern()` — when checking new commits since `last-seen`, filter the diff file list against ignore patterns\n- If a commit touches ONLY ignored files → skip it (advance `last-seen`, no agent invocation)\n- If a commit touches ANY non-ignored files → process normally (full diff, including ignored files — we just use the ignore list for the trigger decision, not for filtering the diff content)\n- Log skipped commits similarly to `[skip ci]` handling\n\n### Example `.detergentignore`\n\n```\n# Beads issue tracker metadata\n.beads/\n\n# Documentation\ndocs/\n*.md\n!README.md\n\n# CI/CD\n.github/\n.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n# Editor/IDE\n.vscode/\n.idea/\n```\n\n### Implementation notes\n\n- Go has `github.com/sabhiram/go-gitignore` for `.gitignore` pattern matching\n- The skip logic should live near the existing `[skip ci]` / `[detergent skip]` marker handling in `processConcern()`\n- The ignore file should be read from the watched branch HEAD (not the worktree), so it reflects the repo's current config\n- Cache the parsed ignore file per poll cycle (not per commit) for performance\n\n### Edge cases\n\n- `.detergentignore` doesn't exist → no filtering (current behavior)\n- Commit modifies `.detergentignore` itself → process it (meta-change, worth reviewing)\n- Merge commits with mixed ignored/non-ignored files → process (conservative)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"daniel@ajps.limited","created_at":"2026-02-18T13:20:29.296618Z","created_by":"Daniel Jones","updated_at":"2026-02-20T19:56:03.841969Z","closed_at":"2026-02-18T20:00:39.666324Z","close_reason":"Implemented .detergentignore support with go-gitignore library"}

{"id":"line-nus","title":"Spike: Test creack/pty interactive mode for streaming agent output","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrent `invokeAgent()` runs `claude -p` (print/pipe mode) with a PTY allocated for stdout/stderr via `creack/pty`. Despite the PTY, Claude Code buffers output internally in `-p` mode, so logs arrive in chunks rather than streaming. The comment in engine.go:579 acknowledges this:\n\n\u003e \"Claude Code batches its output internally regardless of TTY detection, so logs appear in chunks rather than streaming line-by-line.\"\n\nThis makes `detergent logs -f` and `detergent status -f` less useful — you can't watch the agent work in real-time.\n\n## Proposed Approach: Interactive Mode via Existing creack/pty\n\nDrop `-p` flag and run Claude Code in **normal interactive mode** inside the PTY we already allocate. Claude's TUI renders to the PTY in real-time with token-level streaming.\n\n### How it would work\n\n1. Don't pass `-p` to claude — run it interactively\n2. Send the concern prompt via PTY stdin (write to ptmx) instead of `strings.NewReader`\n3. Read streaming output from PTY master (ptmx) — this already happens via `io.Copy`\n4. Detect completion by scanning output for Claude's idle prompt `❯ ` (or similar marker)\n5. Kill the process or send `/exit` when done\n\n### Key unknowns to test (this is a spike)\n\n- Does Claude Code actually stream token-by-token when running interactively in a PTY without a human attached? (Gas Town uses SIGWINCH wake trick to ensure this — may be needed)\n- What does the raw PTY output look like? ANSI escape codes, cursor movements, spinner artifacts, TUI chrome — how much stripping is needed for clean logs?\n- Can we reliably detect the idle prompt `❯ ` from the PTY output stream?\n- How do we handle Claude's initial startup (loading message, etc.) before the prompt is ready?\n- Does `--dangerously-skip-permissions` work without `-p`?\n- Performance: how does startup time compare to `-p` mode?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n1. **`--output-format stream-json`** (with `-p`): Tested. Streams at event/turn granularity, not token granularity. The `assistant` event contains the full response text in one JSON blob. Requires `--verbose` for useful events. Adds JSON parsing complexity. Undocumented/unstable format. Good enough for turn-level progress but not true streaming.\n\n2. **tmux** (Gas Town's approach): Full interactive session management. Gas Town runs Claude as the initial process of a detached tmux session, sends input via `send-keys`, reads output via `capture-pane`, wakes detached sessions with SIGWINCH resize trick. Gives multi-turn capability, `tmux attach` for debugging. But it's an external dependency not pre-installed on macOS, and is overkill for detergent's single-shot concern model.\n\n3. **Stay with current approach**: `-p` mode with PTY for stdout. Works, but logs are chunky.\n\n### Gas Town reference\n\nGas Town (github.com/steveyegge/gastown) solves this with tmux as the PTY layer. Key patterns worth borrowing even without tmux:\n\n- **SIGWINCH wake**: Detached PTY sessions may not process stdin until a terminal event occurs. Gas Town triggers `resize-pane -y -1` then `+1` to wake Claude's event loop. We may need an equivalent — write something to the PTY, or send SIGWINCH directly to the claude process.\n- **Prompt detection**: Gas Town scans `capture-pane` output for `❯ ` prefix to detect idle state. We'd scan PTY output instead.\n- **Send Enter separately**: Gas Town sends text via `send-keys -l` (literal), waits 500ms debounce, then sends Enter as a separate command. Our PTY equivalent: write prompt text to ptmx, sleep, write `\\n`.\n\n### Definition of done\n\nWrite a standalone Go test (or small binary) that:\n1. Launches `claude` (without `-p`) in a creack/pty\n2. Sends a simple prompt via the PTY\n3. Captures output and prints it line-by-line as it arrives (proving streaming works)\n4. Detects when Claude returns to the idle prompt\n5. Documents what the raw output looks like (ANSI codes, etc.)\n6. Determines whether SIGWINCH wake is needed\n\nResult should be a clear go/no-go for this approach, with findings documented.","notes":"## Spike Results (2026-02-19)\n\n### Test setup\n- Standalone binary: cmd/pty-spike/main.go\n- Runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` (no -p) in creack/pty\n- Sends probe: 'Count from 1 to 15, one number per line, nothing else.'\n\n### Findings\n\n**1. CLAUDECODE env var blocks nested sessions**\nFix: filter CLAUDECODE from child env (already in spike binary).\n\n**2. Startup takes ~16 seconds**\nIn -p mode, claude starts producing output in ~1-2s.\nIn interactive mode, the TUI welcome screen takes ~16s to finish loading.\nThis is prohibitive for detergent's use case.\n\n**3. Prompt detection (❯ ) doesn't work as a byte scan**\nThe TUI renders the prompt character using absolute cursor positioning\n(ESC[row;colH then ❯ then ESC sequence then space), so ❯ and the space\nbyte are not contiguous in the PTY stream. Neither raw scan nor simple\nANSI-stripped scan finds the prompt.\n\n**4. Response text not visible without terminal emulator**\nAfter sending the probe, only 3 chunks arrived in 13 seconds:\n  - +15882ms: 624 bytes (input echo + TUI frame redraw)\n  - +20884ms: 101 bytes (status bar update, ⏵⏵ = running indicator)  \n  - +28882ms: 56 bytes (cursor positioning)\nThen zero output for 167 seconds.\n\nThe TUI renders the response using absolute cursor positioning inside\na fixed-size screen buffer. Extracting the actual response text requires\nimplementing a full VT100/xterm terminal emulator, not just stripping ANSI.\n\n**5. Streaming verdict: inconclusive, likely NO**\nWe cannot distinguish 'streaming' from 'batch' without a terminal emulator\nto interpret the screen state. The 3-chunk burst pattern suggests the\nresponse may have been rendered as a complete screen repaint, not as\nprogressive token-by-token output.\n\n### Verdict: NO-GO for this approach\n\nInteractive PTY mode requires:\n1. ~16s startup overhead (vs ~2s for -p mode)  \n2. Full terminal emulator to extract text\n3. Alternative prompt detection (❯  scan doesn't work)\n\n### Recommended next step\nInvestigate --output-format stream-json --verbose (already noted in issue\nas 'turn-level streaming'). Events arrive per-tool-use and per-assistant-turn.\nNot token-level but far simpler and more reliable than TUI parsing.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"daniel@ajps.limited","created_at":"2026-02-17T21:50:03.053839Z","created_by":"Daniel Jones","updated_at":"2026-02-20T19:56:03.842245Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T15:41:16.611366Z","close_reason":"Spike complete.

{"id":"line-tv2","title":"Implement pre-commit gates in line.yaml","description":"# Pre-commit Gates in detergent.yaml\n\n## Context\n\nDetergent's concern chains run post-commit for auditability. A separate, lighter-weight feature is needed for pre-commit quality gates (linters, formatters, type checkers). The design is intentionally minimal: declarative gate config in the existing \\`detergent.yaml\\`, raw text output passthrough, and the user decides whether to include \\`--fix\\` in their gate commands. No external repos, no environment isolation—the project's own dev tooling is already present.\n\n## Design\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\n# detergent.yaml (new section)\ngates:\n  - name: lint\n    run: npx eslint {staged}\n  - name: types\n    run: npx tsc --noEmit\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n- \\`{staged}\\` is an optional template variable replaced with space-separated staged file paths at runtime\n- Gates run in order; first failure short-circuits (fail-fast)\n- Output is raw text passthrough; Claude Code reads it as-is\n- No \\`fix\\` field, no \\`fixable\\` flag—user encodes intent in the \\`run\\` command\n\n## Files to Change\n\n### 1. \\`internal/config/config.go\\`\n\nAdd to \\`Config\\` struct:\n\\`\\`\\`go\nGates []Gate \\`yaml:\"gates,omitempty\"\\`\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAdd new type:\n\\`\\`\\`go\ntype Gate struct {\n    Name string \\`yaml:\"name\"\\`\n    Run  string \\`yaml:\"run\"\\`\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAdd validation in \\`Validate()\\`: gate names must be non-empty and unique, \\`run\\` must be non-empty.\n\n### 2. New \\`internal/cli/gate.go\\`\n\nNew \\`detergent gate\\` subcommand:\n- Loads config\n- Gets list of staged files via \\`git diff --cached --name-only\\`\n- For each gate: substitutes \\`{staged}\\` in the \\`run\\` string, executes via \\`exec.Command(\"sh\", \"-c\", cmd)\\`, streams stdout/stderr to terminal\n- Exits non-zero if any gate fails\n- Prints gate name as header before each run (e.g., \\`--- lint ---\\`)\n- Fail-fast: first failing gate aborts, subsequent gates do not run\n\n### 3. \\`internal/cli/init.go\\`\n\nExtend \\`detergent init\\` to install \\`.git/hooks/pre-commit\\`:\n- Only installs if \\`gates\\` section is present in config\n- Script content:\n  \\`\\`\\`sh\n  #!/bin/sh\n  detergent gate\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Makes the hook executable (\\`chmod +x\\`)\n- Skips/warns if a pre-commit hook already exists (don't clobber)\n- Prints confirmation: \\`Installed .git/hooks/pre-commit\\`\n\n### 4. \\`internal/cli/root.go\\`\n\nRegister the new \\`gate\\` subcommand.\n\n### 5. \\`detergent.yaml\\` (project's own config)\n\nAdd an example \\`gates\\` section with a real gate (e.g., \\`go vet ./...\\` or \\`golangci-lint run\\`).\n\n## Behavior\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n$ git commit -m \"...\"\n--- lint ---\nsrc/foo.ts:12:5 error 'x' is defined but never used\npre-commit hook exited with status 1\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Failure Behavior\n\n**Fail-fast**: First failing gate aborts. Subsequent gates do not run.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Add a \\`gates\\` section to a test repo's \\`detergent.yaml\\`\n2. Run \\`detergent init\\` — verify \\`.git/hooks/pre-commit\\` is created\n3. Stage a file with a lint violation, attempt \\`git commit\\` — verify hook runs and fails with readable output\n4. Fix the violation, re-commit — verify it passes\n5. Run \\`detergent gate\\` directly — verify same behavior as hook\n6. Run \\`detergent validate\\` — verify it catches missing \\`name\\` or \\`run\\` fields","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"daniel@ajps.limited","created_at":"2026-02-20T17:56:04.704417Z","created_by":"Daniel Jones","updated_at":"2026-02-20T21:06:22.973327Z","closed_at":"2026-02-20T21:06:22.973327Z","close_reason":"Implemented: Gate struct in config, line gate subcommand, hook installation via line init, full integration tests"}
